# Live Camera Identification

Currently in the process of training. 

I'm using the cifar-10 dataset for images since I don't have the necessary resources to gather and process larger image datasets.
Using a custom convluted network, since that proves to be decent currently, i have currently trained to 23/200 epochs and I have getting 88.9% overall and in training im seeing upwards of 96.4%. I will continute and look for futher improvement. 

Apparently I wasn't using cuda before because I didn't set it up but now that I did hopefull its a bit faster. 
Achieve a 94% in testing and achieve a 97.89% with a validation of 0.0663. 
Will try to see if I can futher improve the architecture and possible add stochastic model however that  will some time as I am still behind on mathamatics.   

Next i think i'll add more transformations to the images since that would probably make it better
